                <p> This article was contributed by David Mariani, chief technology officer for AtScale. </p>

                <p>An important step in the data maturity of an organization is moving beyond simple historical analysis to generating accurate predictions about the future. In the past, business analysts focused on historical analysis while data science teams attempted to surface interesting insights about the future. Today, with the advent of the semantic layer, these two siloed worlds are coming together. Enterprises that merge these two disciplines can deliver augmented analytics, helping everyone in the organization better understand the past and predict the future.</p>

                <p>Organizations leverage analytics to help them understand and improve their business operations and customer satisfaction. Before we go further, let‚Äôs define the four flavors of analysis we typically see in an organization, each with increasing levels of sophistication.


                  As illustrated by the table above, business users typically focus on historical analysis while data scientists are working to predict the future. It‚Äôs obvious that business users make better decisions if they can anticipate the future. It‚Äôs also obvious that data scientists build better models if they can compare their predictions to what actually happened. In other words, historical analysis and predictive analysis are relevant to both teams, but rarely do the two meet.</p>

                <p>A semantic layer is a business representation of data that makes it easier for end users to access data using common, business-friendly terms. A semantic layer maps complex data relationships into easy-to-understand business terms to deliver a unified, consolidated view of data across the organization. A semantic layer provides the following benefits:</p>

                <p>One of the biggest complaints from the business is that it takes way too long for IT to build or deliver reports for them. Users want to control their destiny, and subject-matter experts (not IT) are best suited to applying data to improve the business. A well-designed semantic layer hides the complexity of data‚Äôs physical form and location while translating data into understandable business constructs. A semantic layer frees business users and data scientists from the dependency on IT and data experts by making data easy to use.</p>

                <p>Today, enterprises have strong and sometimes regulatory requirements to track ‚Äúwho‚Äù saw ‚Äúwhich‚Äù data and ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù A modern semantic layer allows users to appear as themselves to the underlying data platforms from any consumer tool. At the same time, a semantic layer ensures that data is consistent regardless of consumption style and makes sure everyone plays by the same (governance) rules. </p>

                <p>Analytics agility, also thought of as ‚Äútime to insight,‚Äù is how long after data lands that it can be used to make decisions. BI tools that require data imports, extracts, or cube building take anywhere from minutes for small data to days/weeks for large data before data can be accessed. A modern semantic layer leverages data virtualization to enable new data landing in your data warehouse to be query-able by your BI tool immediately, regardless of size.
                </p>

                <p>Cubes and data extracts were introduced to overcome the performance issues of analytics and data platforms. This approach introduces data copies, adds complexity, destroys agility, and introduces latency. A modern semantic layer improves performance regardless of the underlying data model, whether it‚Äôs a snowflake, a star, or purely OLTP schema. By automatically creating and managing aggregates or materialized views inside the underlying data platform, a semantic layer learns from user query patterns and optimizes the data platform‚Äôs performance and cost without data movement.</p>

                <p>With a semantic layer, you can bridge the gap between BI users and data science teams. This enables your teams to work transparently and cooperatively with the same information and with the same goals.
                </p>

                <p>A semantic layer abstracts away the complexity of underlying raw data using a business model, allowing any data consumer to access quantitative metrics, attributes, features, predictions, business hierarchies, and complex calculations in an intuitive, easy-to-understand interface. A semantic layer solution presents this consumer-friendly interface in the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of their tooling (SQL, MDX, DAX, JDBC, ODBC, REST, or Python), translating queries into the dialect of the underlying cloud platform. With a common set of business terms, both teams can interact with the same data, with the same governance rules, with the same results, using the tooling of their choice. </p>

                <p>With both teams working on the same semantic layer solution, data scientists can share (or publish) their generated features and predictions with business analysts, while business analysts provide feedback to data science teams on the quality of their predictions and model drift. Once data becomes highly accessible, teams can collaborate not just within their four walls, but blend data from second and third-party data sources to unlock the power of data and analytics for everyone. Closing the gap between business intelligence and data science teams is the key to achieving a high level of data analytics maturity and applying all types of analytics at scale.</p>

                <p>When business and data science teams collaborate using a semantic layer, they enhance their historical data with predictive insights. Closing the gap between business intelligence and data science teams provides more visibility into the output of data science initiatives throughout the organization and enables organizations to leverage their data for predictive and prescriptive analytics. Augmented intelligence (also called augmented analytics or decision intelligence) brings AI-generated insights into traditional business intelligence workflows to improve data-driven decisions.</p>

                <p>When most people think of augmented intelligence, they think about specific features that may appear in AI-enhanced business intelligence tools. For example, some BI tools add natural language query (NLQ) or outlier analysis to help their users ask better questions or find the needle in the haystack. These are valuable features, but they are confined to the particular tool and may work differently across different tools.</p>

                <p>In contrast, augmenting data through the unification of BI and data science adds AI-enhanced data to the semantic layer, providing the same insights across the consumer spectrum, regardless of the tool used. Essentially, a semantic layer amplifies the effect of the data science team by sharing their work with a wider audience and providing that audience with the ability to deliver feedback on the quality and utility of their predictions ‚Äî a win-win.</p>

                <p>Augmented intelligence has the power to transform businesses into data-driven organizations. This starts with implementing the appropriate processes and tools to democratize data and empower individuals to utilize data through self-service analytics. </p>

                <p>Ultimately, every organization wants to empower every individual to make data-driven decisions. A semantic layer can become the vehicle for delivering augmented intelligence to a broader audience by publishing the results of data science programs through existing BI channels. By feeding data science model results back into the semantic layer, your organization can capture benefits beyond just historical analysis. Decision makers can consume predictive insights alongside historical data. They can also use the same governed data to reliably ‚Äúdrill down‚Äù into the details of a prediction. As a result, your organization can foster more self-service and greater data science literacy and generate a better return on data science investments.</p>

                <p>Wireless providers will shut down 3G throughout the year, leaving an unknown number of devices without service.</p>

                <p>It‚Äôs time to say goodbye to 3G, the wireless technology that gave our phones near-instantaneous access to the web and helped make everything from the Apple App Store to Uber an everyday part of our lives. More than two decades after its launch, wireless service providers are shutting down 3G to clear the way for its faster and flashier successor: 5G.</p>

                <p>The expansion of 5G is welcome news for the growing number of people with 5G-enabled devices, and it could be a critical step toward more advanced technologies, like self-driving cars and virtual reality. But the 3G shutdown will also disable an entire generation of tech: everything from 3G phones to car crash notification systems. For the people who rely on these devices, this transition will cut off a cellular network they‚Äôve depended on for years, and in some cases, disconnect crucial safety equipment.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúThe number of 3G devices has been decreasing steadily,‚Äù Tommaso Melodia, the director of Northeastern‚Äôs Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, told Recode. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs at the point where carriers are starting to say, ‚ÄòIt doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense for us to continue to use these precious frequency channels for 3G. Let‚Äôs turn it off.‚Äô‚Äù</p>

                <p>Ideally, wireless providers could keep both 3G and 5G networks up and running, but the physics of the radio spectrum that cellular technology relies on means that companies have to make a choice. The radio spectrum includes a wide range of frequencies, which are used to connect everything from AM/FM radios to wifi networks, and is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Because there are a limited number of frequencies the agency sets aside for cellular service, wireless providers have to divide up the spectrum that they‚Äôre allocated to run multiple networks, including their 3G, 4G, 5G, and eventually 6G, services.</p>

                <p>The FCC does make new bands of frequencies available to wireless providers through spectrum auctions, during which wireless providers can bid on rights to specific bands. But winning bids can be in the billions of dollars, so providers try to use the spectrum they already have as efficiently as possible. By turning off older generations of cellular technology, companies can repurpose the frequencies in order to improve newer networks, like 4G and 5G. AT&T will go first and shut down its 3G network on February 22, followed by T-Mobile in July and Verizon at the end of the year.</p>

By turning off older generations of cellular technology, companies can repurpose the frequencies in order to improve newer networks, like 4G and 5G. AT&T will go first and shut down its 3G network on February 22, followed by T-Mobile in July and Verizon at the end of the year.</p>

                <p>While the 3G shutdown will come with its own set of consequences, the expansion of more advanced networks should bring better speeds and reception to customers with 4G and 5G devices. 4G is 500 times faster than 3G, according to Verizon, and 5G should be even faster than 4G once it‚Äôs fully turned on. 5G will also come with lower latency, which means you‚Äôll have very little lag when you‚Äôre connected to the internet. This lower latency will make it easier to use your phone for complicated tasks in real time, like playing an online video game or participating in a live telehealth session.</p>

                <p>In the meantime, 3G device owners need to brace for the imminent 3G shutdown. Some may not even know their service is about to go offline. Depending on their provider, these customers may only have a few weeks or months to upgrade their tech. Right now, it‚Äôs not clear they‚Äôll be able to make the switch in time.</p>

                <p>When your phone connects to a cellular network, it sends and receives signals on the frequencies to which that specific network has been assigned. Those signals travel over those frequencies to transmission stations, like cell towers, which are connected to the internet cables that provide your web connection. This is similar to the way a laptop connects to a home wifi network that‚Äôs powered by an internet router.</p>

                <p>In the US, 3G generally runs between 850 megahertz and 1900 to 2100 megahertz frequencies. These sections of the spectrum are useful for both digital voice and internet data, which is what made 3G so exciting when it was first introduced in the late 1990s. Wireless carriers have since developed new equipment and better technology, which they‚Äôve used to launch their 4G and 5G networks. Because these networks can carry more data at a faster rate, wireless providers want to run them on the frequencies they currently use for their 3G networks. And that can only happen if they turn 3G off first.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a one-or-the-other choice,‚Äù said Kevin Ryan, a professor who researches wireless systems at the Stevens Institute of Technology. ‚ÄúIt would be analogous to trying to have two FM radio stations broadcasting at the same frequency.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Aside from the logistics of how radio spectrum works, wireless providers are also reallocating 3G spectrum because it makes more financial sense for them. Verizon and AT&T estimate that less than 1 percent of their service still runs on 3G networks, while 90 million 5G devices shipped in the last year alone. Once 3G is finally turned off, wireless providers can devote more resources to expanding their 5G networks and convincing customers to upgrade their service plans.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúOperators are spending a lot of money for the spectrum, and they have to pass those costs on to the consumers. That‚Äôs why we pay a very high price for cellphone service,‚Äù explains Sundeep Rangan, the associate director of the NYU Wireless technology research center. ‚ÄúThose operators, for that amount of spectrum, want to send as much data, or serve as many users, as possible.‚Äù</p>

                <p>While the 3G shutdown may feel sudden, it isn‚Äôt surprising. Carriers stopped selling 3G devices years ago, and many have spent the past several months notifying their remaining 3G customers that it‚Äôs time to upgrade their tech. 3G isn‚Äôt the first network to go offline, either. 1G, the cellular network that supported analog voice devices, like the brick-sized cellphones in ‚Äô80s movies ‚Äî hasn‚Äôt been operational for decades. Though T-Mobile still supports 2G devices, Verizon and AT&T both shut down their 2G networks several years ago. By the end of 2022, 3G will be gone, too.</p>

                <p>We don‚Äôt know exactly how many, but millions of operational devices throughout the US could be left unconnected when 3G sunsets. Many of these devices include hardware that can‚Äôt be adapted to connect to 4G and 5G networks. If you have one of these devices, you should have already heard from your wireless provider about your next steps. But if you want to double-check, you can research your specific device or reach out to your wireless provider. You can also try checking your phone‚Äôs settings or user manual, or just keep an eye out for a 4G or 5G connection on your device as you go about your day.</p>

                <p>The 3G technology systems that are built into cars are generally supported by a major wireless provider, and they‚Äôll stop working whenever that provider officially shuts down its 3G service. CNBC and Consumer Reports have released lists of known affected car models, but there‚Äôs no reason not to check with your car‚Äôs manufacturer just in case. Cars built in the mid-2010s appear to be the most likely to be affected by the 3G shutdown, but even some cars released in 2020 may need an upgrade.</p>

                <p>There are also 3G devices that are meant for emergencies. Along with some medical and security alert systems, prepaid 3G phones and deactivated 3G phones, which can only call 911, will go offline. Elderly people, people who live in rural areas, low-income people, people experiencing homelessness, and survivors of domestic violence are more likely to rely on these devices. Because people only turn to these devices in extreme circumstances, they may not realize until long after 3G shuts down that they need to be replaced, creating a potentially critical safety issue.</p>

                <p>That‚Äôs why some think that 3G should stay online for a while longer. AARP says the pandemic has prevented many older people from updating their tech, and wants the shutdown pushed back to the end of the year. Alarm companies, including those that manufacture fire and carbon monoxide detectors and home security systems, have also asked for an extension. They say that the computer chip shortage has gotten in the way of their efforts to produce and install replacement devices.</p>

                <p>But you shouldn‚Äôt bet on a delay. If you have a 3G device, the best time to upgrade is now. If you know someone who uses one of these devices, it‚Äôs worth checking in and seeing if you can help them find a replacement.
                </p>

                <p>Inevitably, history shows that cellular networks come and go. The next cellular network, 6G, may be less than a decade away and could be used to introduce everything from 3D holograms to internet-connected clothing. At that point, 5G won‚Äôt seem so new and exciting anymore, and 4G‚Äôs time will likely be up.</p>

                <p>Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Defense reported Tuesday that it has suffered a cyberattack, while the Ukrainian government also disclosed that cyberattacks struck two banks in the country.</p>

                <p>The State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine said in a statement posted online that there was a ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack Tuesday against ‚Äúa number of information resources of Ukraine.‚Äù The affected targets included the websites of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the web services of Privatbank and Oschadbank.</p>

                <p>It was not immediately certain that Russia, which has amassed an estimated 130,000 troops near Ukraine, is connected to any of the cyberattacks.</p>

                <p>On the website of ArmyINFORM, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine‚Äôs information agency, a translation of a post today says the ministry experienced a cyberattack that was ‚Äúprobably‚Äù a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúThe official web portal of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine probably suffered DDoS attacks when an excessive number of requests per second was recorded,‚Äù the translation of the post says.</p>

                <p>Technical work to restore the portal is underway, according to the translation of the post.</p>

                <p>The Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security, a wing of the nation‚Äôs culture ministry, also confirmed the attack in a statement and said that the attack had shut down access to the defense ministry‚Äôs site, according to a Reuters report.</p>

                <p>The statement did not specify who is being blamed for it, but the Reuters report suggested that the statement could be interpreted as accusing Russia.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIt is not ruled out that the aggressor used tactics of little dirty tricks because its aggressive plans are not working out on a large scale,‚Äù the Ukrainian information security said in the statement cited by Reuters.</p>

                <p>Christian Sorensen, former operational planning team lead for the U.S. Cyber Command, told VentureBeat today that these attacks ‚Äúare ratcheting up attention and pressure.‚Äù</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt sounds like much impact yet,‚Äù Sorensen said in an email. ‚ÄúIn the coming hours and days, I would anticipate more activities to isolate and disrupt Ukrainian citizens and especially government activities. The purpose at this stage is to increase leverage in negotiations. Next stage will be impactful and continue deterrence for other countries to get involved.‚Äù</p>

                <p>The Russian build-up near Ukraine includes armored vehicles, ships, and aircraft, according to reports.</p>

                <p>In mid-January, a day after the failure of diplomatic efforts to halt the Russian troop build-up, more than 70 Ukrainian government websites were targeted with the new ‚ÄúWhisperGate‚Äù family of malware. Ukraine blamed Russia for the attacks, which left many of the government‚Äôs websites inaccessible or defaced.</p>

                <p>Cybersecurity experts say that if Russia does plan to invade Ukraine, it would undoubtedly use cyberattacks as a key part of its strategy ‚Äî just as the country has done in previous military campaigns over the past decade-and-a-half, including in Georgia and the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúIn these previous conflicts, cyber was used to facilitate a Russian occupation that remains today in previously sovereign territory of another country,‚Äù said Sorensen, who is now founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm SightGain, in a previous email. ‚ÄúIn this way, cyber is tightly integrated into Russian tactics.‚Äù</p>

                <p>If an invasion does occur, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not really a question of whether cyberattacks on Ukraine will take place,‚Äù said Mathieu Gorge, author of The Cyber Elephant in the Boardroom and the founder and CEO and of cybersecurity firm VigiTrust.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúBringing down critical infrastructure in Ukraine, or any opponent‚Äôs sovereign state infrastructure, is a tactic to either proceed or augment physical attacks,‚Äù Gorge said in a previous email. ‚ÄúThe idea behind it is that if you cripple the country physically at their border while crippling access to banking, electricity, health services, and IT systems, your attack is much more powerful.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Russia‚Äôs strategy will be to generally spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt ‚Äî both before and during an active/shooting conflict ‚Äî and to target military personnel and communications during active conflict, Sorensen said.</p>

                <p>In prior attacks, cyber was used as a diversion ‚Äî in order to confuse the targets enough to ‚Äúnot put up a big fight or get organized until it was too late,‚Äù Sorensen said.</p>

                <p>On Friday, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) posted a warning about the potential for attacks against U.S. targets by Russia in connection with the tensions over Ukraine.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúWhile there are not currently any specific credible threats to the U.S. homeland, we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine,‚Äù CISA said in its ‚ÄúShields Up‚Äù warning. ‚ÄúCISA recommends all organizations ‚Äî regardless of size ‚Äî adopt a heightened posture when it comes to cybersecurity and protecting their most critical assets.‚Äù</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Russian cyberattacks against western targets have reportedly already taken place in connection with the Ukraine tensions. Last month, a Russia-linked hacker group is believed to have launched a cyberattack against a western government organization in Ukraine, according to researchers at Palo Alto Networks‚Äô Unit 42. The attack involved a ‚Äútargeted phishing attempt‚Äù and attempted delivery of malware, Unit 42 reported.</p>

                <p>The leadership of the group, which Unit 42 has referred to as ‚ÄúGamaredon,‚Äù includes five Russian Federal Security Service officers, the Security Service of Ukraine said previously. Unit 42 did not identify or further describe the western government entity that was targeted by Gamaredon.</p>

              <div class="articleContainer">
                <p>Netlify, the company behind a platform used by developers to build, host, and scale web projects, today announced what it calls a ‚Äúnew approach‚Äù to building with APIs that it hopes will boost developer productivity.</p>

                <p>Netlify, which counts customers such as Citrix, Verizon, and Twilio, helps companies move away from traditional monolithic web apps to a decoupled architecture, where the front- and backends are separate. Using Netlify, developers connect their code repository, add build settings, and then Netlify takes care of deployment and the necessary infrastructure.</p>

                <p>Netlify Graph, which is available now in open beta, is all about APIs (application programming interfaces) ‚Äî it enables developers to securely read, write, and subscribe to data from third-party APIs without managing authentication tokens or having to write any API-specific code ‚Äî single-click authentication is the name of the game.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúNetlify Graph simplifies how developers build, which in turn lifts up the entire ecosystem ‚Äî it will also make decoupling developers‚Äô monoliths into a Jamstack architecture much easier,‚Äù Netlify‚Äôs head of ecosystem Den Delimarsky told VentureBeat. ‚ÄúTeams that were previously handcuffed to monolithic plugins will be able to unlock the vast ecosystem of third-party APIs and services for their web applications.‚Äù</p>

                <p>The announcement comes just a few months after Netlify raised $105 million and acquired OneGraph, a GraphQL-based tool for building third-party integrations. GraphQL, which Facebook open-sourced back in 2015, is helping to power the burgeoning API economy and the push towards microservices ‚Äî that is, software built from smaller purpose-built components that are easier to maintain versus giant monolithic applications. GraphQL APIs give developers flexibility to query specific data from disparate sources, and makes cross-platform app development simpler.</p>

                <p>Built atop GraphQL, Netlify Graph promises to ‚Äúeliminate the messy backend integration work‚Äù involved in working with APIs, with pre-built integrations at launch for GitHub, NPM, Salesforce, Spotify, Stripe, Box, and Contentful.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúThis is a huge boost for developer productivity and accelerates time-to-market,‚Äù Delimarsky said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no denying APIs are core to building modern web applications, but we‚Äôre seeing developers spending more and more time discovering, securing, and governing all these APIs, which is actually creating more complexity and taking them away from focusing on business value. Discovering APIs can be easy, but the bigger challenge is governing and combining them into a more cohesive experience.‚Äù</p>

                <p>And so, Netlify Graph essentially gives developers a more unified way of authenticating and building using APIs, making it easier to integrate and consume third-party services directly through the Netlify interface.</p>

                <p>After a short period in private beta which required users to specifically activate the feature, Netlify Graph is now enabled by default for all Netlify customers. While the company hasn‚Äôt revealed what other integrations it might include in the future beyond the initial five, its OneGraph acquisition gives a hint as to what might be around the corner ‚Äî OneGraph currently supports Zendesk, Trello, Intercom, HubSpot, Slack, among others.</p>

                <p>‚ÄúThis is only phase one and we plan to add more integrations over time,‚Äù Delimarsky confirmed.</p>

              <div class="articleContainer">
                <p>Here we are, more than two years into the pandemic, and many of the sudden changes brought about by COVID-19 have become permanent. Among them is a deepened and growing dependence on cloud computing, accelerated by an unprecedented separation of businesses from specific physical premises.</p>

                <p>While reliance on the largest public cloud vendors ‚Äî particularly AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud ‚Äî has grown, so too have concerns about whether these are really the right bets for many organizations to make.</p>

                <p>For all their strengths, three significant problems with the Big Tech clouds have become clear.</p>

                <p>Over the past few years many cloud users have realized something that we at Vultr have long known ‚Äî the Big Tech clouds are far more expensive than necessary. Simply said, they cost more than they need to for the services provided, and users end up paying for more services than they actually need.</p>

                <p>Amazon‚Äôs earnings reports have shown the world that AWS generates billions in annual profits, with bandwidth for data transfer being the most egregiously overpriced service of all.</p>

                <p>The Big Tech clouds‚Äô excessively high prices have led to what venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) calls The Trillion Dollar Paradox.</p>

                <p>As he wrote, ‚ÄúAcross 50 of the top public software companies currently utilizing cloud infrastructure, an estimated $100B of market value is being lost among them due to cloud impact on margins ‚Äî relative to running the infrastructure themselves. [Across] the broader universe of scale public companies that stand to benefit from related savings, we estimate that the total impact is potentially greater than $500B.‚Äù</p>

                <p>The ultimate conclusion from a16z is a conundrum: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy if you don‚Äôt start in the cloud,‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre crazy if you stay on it.‚Äù Whether you are one of the largest cloud users in the world, or an individual developer, the odds are that you are overpaying for cloud computing.</p>

                <p>The vision for amazon.com has long been to be the ‚Äúeverything store,‚Äù and it‚Äôs clear that AWS is trying to be the ‚Äúeverything cloud.‚Äù However, while amazon.com seeks to be the low-cost, straightforward retail marketplace for everyone, AWS has become the high-priced, complex cloud. This is for the simple reason that AWS is focused on satisfying the complicated needs of the largest enterprise customers, and serving those with the largest cloud budgets.</p>

                <p>Most developers and businesses don‚Äôt need the vast majority of the hundreds of products offered by AWS and the other Big Tech clouds. Nor do developers and SMBs have the time or specialized staff required to wade through the associated complexities.</p>

                <p>For most users, the 80-20 rule applies to cloud computing, and it only takes a small portion of the Big Tech clouds‚Äô products to deliver the vast majority of cloud utility. AWS boasts about the comprehensiveness of its offerings, but it can present an overwhelming and confusing user experience. Basic functions require excessive time and cost with the Big Tech clouds. Mistakes happen, leading to bugs, downtime, or leaks of customer data. For cloud customers, this hidden cost of complexity is immense.</p>

                <p>If one thing has become clear about Big Tech over the past fifteen years, it‚Äôs that they are ambitious and seek to make customers increasingly reliant on them. The Big Tech companies continuously introduce new products, and entrepreneurs building cloud-based services justifiably worry about these large companies cloning their ideas.</p>

                <p>Long-established companies engaged in digital transformation also increasingly find themselves in competition with these large internet empires. For many cloud computing customers, the choice of provider is becoming as much about avoiding fueling a competitor as it is about meeting their cloud needs.</p>

                <p>Today, cloud customers are left wondering whether they are really damned if they do, and damned if they don‚Äôt.</p>

                <p>But I believe that the answer to a16z‚Äôs Trillion Dollar Paradox has been hiding in plain sight.</p>

                <p>For years, independent cloud computing platforms such as Vultr have built a loyal following within the global developer community by offering cost-effective, high-performance, and easy-to-use cloud infrastructure. Vultr, in particular, has flown under the radar, as it is a completely bootstrapped, profitable business that never needed to raise venture capital.</p>

                <p>Last year‚Äôs IPOs in the sector naturally brought increased attention to independent cloud providers, as companies like DigitalOcean and Backblaze became public. More importantly though, it‚Äôs the quiet evolution of the capabilities of independent clouds that marks the dawn of a new era. Some independent clouds have transitioned from an early narrow focus on providing inexpensive virtual machines into comprehensive platforms that address the full range of users‚Äô fundamental cloud compute, cloud storage, and networking needs.</p>

                <p>Vultr‚Äôs offerings have certainly evolved in this way, and the operating efficiency that has enabled the company to bootstrap itself to scale has also enabled a broader set of capabilities. Unlike other independent clouds, Vultr is able to offer bare metal servers in addition to cloud compute instances, meeting the needs of users seeking cloud economics and cloud provisioning along with the highest level of control and efficiency. In addition, Vultr has been able to significantly grow its global footprint. Over the past six months Vultr has expanded to 22 global locations, including new sites in S√£o Paulo, Mexico City, Stockholm, Warsaw, and Madrid.</p>

                <p>As independent cloud providers mature, they will increasingly be viewed not just as easier-to-use and lower-cost alternatives for small businesses, but as the price-to-performance optimizing choice for a large number of enterprise use cases. Some businesses will see independent clouds as a way to broaden their vendor portfolio, lowering concentration risk and reducing their overall costs through a multi-cloud strategy. Others will leverage independent clouds as efficient backup infrastructure to limit the business impact and cost of outages. Still others will embrace independent clouds just for their straightforward and predictable pricing, and to avoid the high bandwidth charges of Big Tech clouds.</p>

                <p>Whatever your specific cloud goals are, pay attention to the emerging category of independent cloud providers. As with all sectors of technology, the features that initially draw users to the largest vendors eventually become available in more cost-effective and user-friendly ways through newer, disruptive providers. This market evolution has already occurred in cloud computing, even though most users have yet to benefit from the disruption.</p>

                <p>a16z‚Äôs Trillion Dollar Paradox demands a solution, and independent cloud computing platforms such as Vultr are poised to meet the needs of global users who have until recently been at the mercy of Big Tech.</p>
